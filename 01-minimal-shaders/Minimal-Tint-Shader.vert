#version 150
/* 
   Specifies the GLSL language version used by this vertex shader.

   "#version 150" corresponds to GLSL 1.50,
   introduced with OpenGL 3.2.

   This version:
     - uses modern "in" and "out" qualifiers
     - removes deprecated fixed-function pipeline features
     - is compatible with Panda3D’s GLSL system

in vec4 p3d_Vertex;
/*
   Declares a vertex position input attribute.

   "in" indicates that this variable is supplied
   per vertex from the model’s vertex buffer.

   "p3d_Vertex" is a built-in Panda3D attribute
   containing the vertex position in model-local space.

   Type: vec4
     x, y, z → spatial coordinates
     w       → usually 1.0 for positions
*/


uniform mat4 p3d_ModelViewProjectionMatrix;
/*
   Declares a uniform transformation matrix.

   A "uniform":
     - is constant for all vertices in a draw call
     - is provided by the application (Panda3D)

   "p3d_ModelViewProjectionMatrix" combines:
     - Model transformation
     - View (camera) transformation
     - Projection (perspective) transformation

   This matrix converts model-space positions
   into clip-space coordinates.

   Entry point of the vertex shader.

   This function is executed once per vertex
   processed by the GPU.

   The vertex shader’s primary responsibility
   is to compute the final position of each vertex.

    gl_Position = p3d_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * p3d_Vertex;
    /*
       Writes the final transformed vertex position.

       "gl_Position" is a required built-in output variable.

       The multiplication applies:
         model space → world space
         world space → camera space
         camera space → clip space

       The GPU uses gl_Position to determine
       where the vertex appears on screen.
